# TypeScript-PostgreSQL Workshop

## Introduction

Welcome to the TypeScript-PostgreSQL workshop! This workshop is designed to help you understand and implement basic operations in TypeScript and PostgreSQL. The problem statements focus on product management operations such as searching, deleting, and updating product records.

## Problem Statements

### Problem 1: Product Search and Deletion in TypeScript

In this problem, you will implement a function in TypeScript that searches for a product in a list. After displaying the product details, the function should delete the product record from the list.

### Problem 2: Product Deletion and Update in PostgreSQL

This problem involves PostgreSQL database operations. You will write SQL queries to delete and update a product from a table. Additionally, you will implement a trigger in PostgreSQL to move the deleted record to a backup table.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the necessary npm packages using the command `npm install`.
4. Start your PostgreSQL server.

## Running the Application

1. Compile the TypeScript files using the command `tsc`.
2. Run the compiled JavaScript files using the command `npm start`.
3. Connect to your PostgreSQL server and execute the SQL queries.

## Summary

This workshop will help you understand the basics of TypeScript and PostgreSQL. By solving the problem statements, you will gain hands-on experience in implementing CRUD operations in TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
